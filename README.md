# Some of my (very) small coding projects

## Mandelbrot Set

Generates a Mandelbrot Set in either ascii, pixels or coloured pixels. Uses recursive function.

The ascii geneation is slightly warped (characters are taller than they are wide).

Quite inefficient, but works and isn't too complex (unlike the numbers used! (see what I did there?)).

## Sierpinski Carpet

Generates a Sierpinski Carpet with the chaos game. Essentially:
- Pick a random starting point (don't place this one though).
- Pick a random corner or edge midpoint.
- Place a point 2/3 of the distance from the point to the chosen corner/edge.
- Repeat with the new point.

I could of course generate this much faster normally, but I though the chaos game approach was interesting.
